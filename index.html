             <p class='text'>On the Mediterranean coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant of this is paella del senyoret which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born. This paella is sometimes called preparación barroca (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.

             During the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo), vegetables and many different seasonings. However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.

             Throughout non-Valencia Spain, mixed paella is relatively easy to find. Some restaurants both in Spain and abroad that serve this mixed version refer to it as Paella valenciana. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencia recipes are authentic, and generally view all others as inferior, not genuine or even grotesque.

             According to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan.

             Some recipes call for paella to be settled for ten minutes.</p>

             <p class='text'>I can't think of anything I'd rather have than really good sushi and sashimi. But what about Japanese delicacies that venture far beyond raw fish, rice and seaweed?

             What about ankimo, the liver of a monkfish? It's the great delicacy of Japanese cuisine.

             This traditional dish is becoming increasingly popular in sushi bars, especially upscale ones, despite concerns that monkfish are overfished.

             Though available year-round in the United States, ankimo is traditionally a winter delicacy in Japan. Yoshi Tome, owner of Sushi Ran in Sausalito, describes it as "very rich and creamy, but yet at the same time very light and delicate, feeling silky and velvety to the palate."

             The traditional way to serve ankimo is to steam it and serve it with scallions and grated daikon mixed with momiji oroshi (red pepper sauce), and ponzu sauce.

             Some restaurants, such as Kabuto A&S in San Francisco's Richmond district, also serve it sushi-style, wrapped in nori with rice, with the traditional condiments and ponzu drizzled on top. Unlike other Japanese seafood dishes, ankimo is never eaten with soy sauce, which can overwhelm the liver's delicate flavor. The acidity from ponzu sauce alleviates any fishy smell, and instead of wasabi, momiji oroshi provides a kick of hot red pepper and horseradish.

             Ankimo has been eaten in Japan longer than anyone can trace. Many believe that fishermen first prepared it because they could not afford to discard any part of their catch, including the big liver. And it is big. One monkfish liver generally is more than a half-foot long and weighs over a pound.</p>

             <p class='text'>Wagyu beef has become synonymous with beer fed, massaged beef that no-one can afford. Just one look at the menu’s of many New York steakhouses and you’ll see that Wagyu from Japan lists at around $30 per OUNCE!

             Now I’m definitely one to pay the extra buck for quality food, but 30 bucks a bite is a bit steep even for me. I’ve tried both Australian, and American raised Wagyu which are both cheaper than the Japanese kind and while admittedly good, they left me wondering why I paid so much for something only marginally better than a good grass-fed steak.

             So Saturday I’m at the Mitsuwa in Edgewater, New Jersey doing my monthly Japanese food run and I noticed these big banners advertising Ohmi Wagyu beef. I’ve seen them carry Wagyu before but they were expensive, and given my past experiences I had no desire to spend $40 for a small steak. As I worked my way to the meat section, I noticed a massive crowd gathered around a table that was wafting a heavenly scent. Samples!

             As you probably guessed by now, one taste is all it took before I was hooked. I had the beautifully marbled steak you see above in my cart before the buttery flavor of the sample had left my mouth. A quarter pound of beef for two people isn’t much, but really you have to think of this as foie gras or caviar. It’s something you savor for its deliciousness, not something you’d make an entire meal out of. And delicious it was. I sliced it up, got a pan super hot and quickly seared each side, dipping it in some cherry wood smoked salt and sesame oil on the way to my mouth.</p>
